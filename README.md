Functional programming in Go

## Benefits of FP

1. Local reasoning
1. Combinability
1. Easier testing
1. Robust systems
1. "Programs are written at a higher level, and are therefore easier to comprehend"
1. "Parallel/concurrent programming is easier"

See more details from [Alvin Alexander](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/fp-book/benefits-of-functional-programming/)

## Enablers of FP

1. Side effect free code
1. Immutable data
1. Transformation of data instead of step by step refinement
1. Category theory

## Most convenient style of FP

1. Recursion
1. Builtin special for loops: Map, FlatMap, Filter, Fold, Unfold
1. Collection methods: Head, Tail, Take, Drop, Partition
1. Pattern matching
